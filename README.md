# BacktracingPractice

## A Haskell Trading Utility Tool to backtest different algorithms/strategies

## How To Use:

For now, there is a csv file input folder (cases) and a csv file output folder (output).
There is no command line utility, the program has to be edited, compiled and run for the different use cases. 

**NOTE:** The only strategy implemented currently is the double moving average cross over.

## To Do:
1. Combine with gnuplot scripts to generate user readable graphs as the outputs of the strategies
2. Implement Buy/Sell signals
3. Simulate Initial Investment and profits/losses on Buy/Sell
